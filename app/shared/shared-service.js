Increasing calls for protectionism seemingly goes against the rapid process that is globalization. Will further protectionism divide us, unions as we know them as well as our political opinions? Europe’s answer is clear and powerful, as Emmanuel Macron’s election has been a decisive call for unity, countering the increasing weight in the right wings of European politics. The upcoming elections in Germany will reveal if the global swing to the right has come to a preliminary end.\nUncertainty is the best-known unknown, and the world is settling into what seems to be a new normal. In the face of this new reality we must deliberate on how to stand united and cope with future political as well as business challenges in our highly complex and interconnected world. \n"},
